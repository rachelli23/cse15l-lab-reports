To not continously rewrite my username and to save a lot of time I made a .ssh/config file. Making edits in VSCode, I save time by making an alias so the computer remembers my username and I don't have to rewrite it multple times. I also copied a file using the alias.

Coping from my local machine which is the markdown-parse2 directory to my remote machine which is my ieng6 account. I made a new folder called Markdown-Parse3 in my ieng6 account to have the copy of markdownparser. Then complied and ran in my ieng6 account. Ran combing scp, ;, and ssh to copy the whole directory
